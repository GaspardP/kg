# kg - A kilo inspired editor in Rust

The goal of this project is to:

- Follow the [kilo-tutorial][kilo-tutorial] as closely as possible. The commits
  will match the chapters / sub-chapters split.
- Rely on the same features as the C implementation. The project will make use
  of the C POSIX library and the VT100 escape sequences.
- Learn about the language constructs specific to Rust and use them when it
  simplifies the code (the code should be as idiomatic as possible).
- Focus on the implementation of the editor's feature by using crates that
  abstracts the Rust/C bindings (e.g. limit the use of `unsafe`).

The project depends on:

- [nix][nix] for abstracting and providing a safe interface to the C POSIX
  library.
- [termios-rs][termios-rs] to provide safe bindings the the C termios library.


## Usage

- `Ctrl+q` to quit
- `Ctrl+s` to save the file
- the arrow keys to move the cursor
- `PgUp` and `PgDn` to move the cursor to the top or bottom of the screen
- `Home` to move the cursor at the beginning of the line
- `End` to move the cursor at the end of the line

```bash
# Build the application
cargo build

# Start the application
cargo run

# Validate changes before publishing
cargo test && cargo v && cargo fmt
```
